# Discrete and free algorithm

The following is an implementation in Magma of an algorithm described in [1]. It takes as input a finitely generated subgroup G of SL(2,Q) (viewed as a p-adic matrix group for a specified prime p) and determines whether or not G is discrete and free. It proceeds by computing and comparing translation lengths on the corresponding Bruhat-Tits tree.
